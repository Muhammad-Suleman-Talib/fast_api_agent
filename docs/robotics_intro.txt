Robotics: An Introduction

Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can assist humans in a variety of tasks, from manufacturing and exploration to healthcare and entertainment.

Key Components of a Robot:
1.  **Manipulator/Effector:** The part of the robot that interacts with the environment (e.g., an arm, gripper, or wheel).
2.  **Sensors:** Devices that allow the robot to perceive its surroundings (e.g., cameras, lidar, touch sensors).
3.  **Controller:** The "brain" of the robot, which processes sensor data and sends commands to the manipulators.
4.  **Actuators:** Components that convert energy into physical motion (e.g., motors, hydraulics).
5.  **Power Supply:** Provides the energy needed for the robot's operation.

Applications of Robotics:
*   **Industrial Automation:** Manufacturing, assembly, packaging.
*   **Healthcare:** Surgical robots, prosthetics, rehabilitation.
*   **Exploration:** Space probes, underwater vehicles, drones.
*   **Service Robotics:** Cleaning robots, delivery robots, personal assistants.

The field of robotics continues to evolve rapidly, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, materials science, and computing power.
