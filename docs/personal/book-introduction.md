## 🧠 Why This Book Was Created

The world is entering a new era where artificial intelligence is no longer limited to the digital world.  
It is now stepping into **physical form** — becoming embodied, interactive, autonomous, and human-like.

This book, **_Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics_**, was created to guide learners, engineers, and researchers through the complete journey of building intelligent machines that can **sense, move, decide, and interact** with the world.

Traditional robotics books focus on hardware.  
AI books focus only on data and models.  
But **today’s humanoid robots need both**:

- Physical movement  
- Intelligent decision-making  
- Real-time sensing  
- Human-level communication  
- Stable engineering architecture  

This book unifies all of these into one complete resource.
